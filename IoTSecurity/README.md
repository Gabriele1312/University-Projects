# üõ°Ô∏è IOT SECURITY AND PRIVACY

## Abstract
IoT systems are characterized by numerous and different devices that handle vast amounts of
sensitive information. The heterogeneity and limited computational resources introduce significant
vulnerabilities, necessitating ad-hoc solution which respect to traditional security measures.
The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of current IoT security requirements,
potential vulnerabilities, and types of attacks, particularly focusing on smart homes. This study
clearly demonstrates that while numerous best practices and solutions for enhancing IoT security
and privacy exists, with significant advancements in security protocols, encryption methods, and
intrusion detection systems; there is no single, unified, and well-defined approach that
comprehensively addresses cyber, physical and human aspects.
