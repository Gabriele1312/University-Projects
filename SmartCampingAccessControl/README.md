# 🛡️ACCESS CONTROL IMPLEMENTATION IN A SMART HOME CAMPING SYSTEM
To explore the project in detail, please consult the following file: `Project_Final_Report`

## 🔍 Overview
The project is designed to implement an access control system for a smart
camping management system. The project aims to establish a robust access
control mechanism for an organization that oversees multiple campsites within
the same chain, utilizing Oracle as the underlying database platform. The
access control system is designed to ensure secure, efficient, and user-friendly
management of access permissions, tailored to the specific needs of different
user roles and departments within the organization. This implementation
enhances the security and operational efficiency of managing a network of
campsites.
