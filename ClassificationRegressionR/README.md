# üìä Diabetes Prediction and Wine Quality

## üç¨ Diabetes Classification
**Description**: The aim of this task is to conduct a binary classification problem, with R
language, on a diabetes dataset, employing advanced machine learning models
to predict the presence or absence of diabetes based on various health-related
features. 

**Dataset**: This [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set) is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes
and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Several constraints were placed on the
selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients
here are females at least 21 years old of Prima Indian Heritage.

**Objective**: The primary goal is to build a robust predictive models capable of classify-
ing samples into distinct categories; those with and without diabetes. This 
classification task is crucial for early detection and effective management of
diabetes, a prevalent health condition with significant public health implica-
tions.

**Classification Models**:
1. Random Forest Classifier
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
