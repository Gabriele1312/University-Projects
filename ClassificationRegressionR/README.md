## üç¨ Diabetes Classification
**Description**: The aim of this task is to conduct a binary classification problem, with R
language, on a diabetes dataset, employing advanced machine learning models
to predict the presence or absence of diabetes based on various health-related
features. 

**Dataset**: This [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set) is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes
and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Several constraints were placed on the
selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients
here are females at least 21 years old of Prima Indian Heritage.

**Objective**: The primary goal is to build a robust predictive models capable of classify-
ing samples into distinct categories; those with and without diabetes. This 
classification task is crucial for early detection and effective management of
diabetes, a prevalent health condition with significant public health implica-
tions.

**Classification Models**:
1. Random Forest Classifier
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## üç∑ Wine Quality Regression
**Description**: The focus of this task in to conduct the regression analysis of a dataset asso-
ciated with the red variants of Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. This serves as a comprehensive resource for investigating the relationships between physicochemical attributes and sensory characteristics of the wine.

**Dataset**: The current information set, available from the [UCI machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality) consists of 1599 data points, related to physicochemical properties of the wine.

**Objective**: The primary goal is to employ regression techniques, to analyze
the dataset and derive models that can predict the quality of wine based
on its physicochemical properties. Be delving into these relationships, the
regression task aim on understanding the influence of various input features on
the sensory output, and ultimately, finding optimal coefficients that result in
models capable of accurately predicting the final evaluation of the dependent
variable.

**Classification Models**:
1. K-Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN)
2. Ridge Regression
